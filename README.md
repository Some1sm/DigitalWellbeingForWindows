_Windows Defender SmartScreen will block the installation of this file. Read the source code if you have any doubts, or run a [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) scan._

- You may have multiple versions of this app installed. Just uninstall older versions via Control Panel / Settings.

## Troubleshooting

### App crashing when opened
If the app crashes upon opening, try:
1. Uninstall.
2. Delete the contents of `dailylogs` folder
  - `WIN + R` to open the Run window.
  - Paste this then hit enter: `%LOCALAPPDATA%/digital-wellbeing/dailylogs`
  - Delete all `.log` files
3. Re-install the latest version.

This will remove app usage history, but will mostly fix the issues. If the app is still crashing, go to: 
```bat
%LOCALAPPDATA%/digital-wellbeing/internal-logs
```
Send me the `.log` file for the current day when the crash happens. This will help me identify the issue.

### App icons not showing
Fetching icons from running apps is a hit or miss. For better chances, try running the app in administrator mode. (`Right Click > Run as Administrator`).
